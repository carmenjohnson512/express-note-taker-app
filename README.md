## Description

The Express Note Taker App is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves/retrieves note data from a JSON file. The npm uuidv4 module assigns a unique ID to each newly created note.

The application allows users to:

1) Create and save notes
2) View previously saved notes
3) Delete previously saved notes

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes. I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before, SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
